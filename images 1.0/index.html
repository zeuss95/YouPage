                <p>Ever since I have been launched into the the IT field, I have been fascinated by the very components which make up the IT field. From the invention of self regenerating stem cells to the invention of the latest Tesla model, technology have enhanced the lives of the human population in a variety of ways. Technology is evolving at a rapid rate which could end up ;eaving humanity behind if we are not careful. The new technological advancements could either help or harm humanity, depending on how we use it.</p>

                <p>Worked the role as a Quality Analyst during a group project I worked on during an i.c.stars internship I was in. In order to create the app we first worked on the UI/UX aspects of the application we were working on. The UI/UX components of the app consisted of theings such as pictures, navigation bars, and anything else that a person would interact with when using an app. </p>

                <h1 class="headings">Professional Networking</h1>
                <p>Networking is an obvious but crucial part of the IT field. One must be able to be able to work efficiently while simultaniously being able to get along with your other coworkers within the work space. You must be able to disipher what is appropriate and what is not depending on the settings we are in. People usually work better and more efficiently when they are cooperating in a group setting. SO it is very important to know how to properly network with anyone you interact with.</p>
